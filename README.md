# Prize Distribution
Ethereum smart contracts for decentralized distribution of prizes. 

Useful for running competitions where multiple entrants compete for a shared prize pool.

The prizes are allocated algorithmically using a modified Fibonacci distribution, such that a larger portion of the prize pool is skewed towards the players that rank highest.

## Compile

Run `truffle compile` to build the contracts.

## Testing

Run `truffle test` to run the tests.
